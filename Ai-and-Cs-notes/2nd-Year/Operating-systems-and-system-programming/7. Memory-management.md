# Memory Management

Memory management is a critical aspect of operating systems, involving the management of a limited resource: memory. Here are the key points:

## Logical vs. Physical Address Space
- **Logical Address:** Generated by the CPU; also known as a virtual address.
- **Physical Address:** The actual address seen by the memory unit.
- Important in execution-time address-binding schemes, where logical and physical addresses differ.

## Address Binding
- **Compile Time:** If the memory location is known a priori, absolute code can be generated.
- **Load Time:** Generates relocatable code if the memory location is not known at compile time.
- **Execution Time:** Binding delayed until run time; requires hardware support for address maps (e.g., base and limit registers).

## Swapping
- Swapping involves moving processes to and from disk and memory.
- Issues include swap time (transfer time) and handling pending I/O.

## Fragmentation
- **External Fragmentation:** Free memory is available but not contiguous.
- **Internal Fragmentation:** Allocated memory may be slightly larger than requested memory.
- **Compaction:** Technique to deal with fragmentation by shuffling memory contents.

## Paging
- Divides physical memory into fixed-size blocks called frames and logical memory into blocks called pages.
- **Page Table:** Translates logical addresses to physical addresses.
- Avoids external fragmentation and simplifies memory allocation.

## Segmentation
- Divides memory into segments based on logical divisions like code, data, and stack.
- **Segment Table:** Maps two-dimensional logical addresses (segment number and offset) to physical addresses.

## Virtual Memory
- Separates user logical memory from physical memory.
- **Demand Paging:** Only loads pages into memory when they are needed, reducing the amount of physical memory required.

## Page Replacement Algorithms
- **FIFO:** Simple but can suffer from Belady's anomaly in which increasing the number of page frames results in an increase in the number of page faults.
- **Optimal:** Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period (ideal but impractical).
- **LRU:** Uses past behavior to predict future usage, replacing the least recently used page.

## Thrashing
- Occurs when a process does not have enough pages, leading to constant page faults.
- Solutions include the working-set model and page-fault frequency strategies.
