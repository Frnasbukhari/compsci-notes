# Operating Systems: Design Principles and System Calls

## 1. Operating System (OS) Overview

**Functions of an Operating System:**
- **Resource Allocator:** Manages hardware resources and decides between conflicting requests.
- **Control System:** Controls program execution to prevent errors and improper use of the computer.

**Examples of Operating Systems:**
- Windows, Mac OS, Linux, TinyOS for Internet of Things.

## 2. Basic Building Blocks of an OS

**Bootstrapping:**
- Small program (BIOS/firmware) initializes the system and loads the OS kernel at power-up or reboot.

**Device Controllers:**
- Hardware that manages specific devices.
- Communicates with the CPU via interrupts.

**Interrupts:**
- Interrupt Vector: Memory area that tracks interrupts.
- Interrupt Service Routine (ISR): Handles the interrupt.
- Software-generated interrupts (traps) for errors or system calls.

**Storage Structure:**
- **Main Memory:** Directly accessible by the CPU.
- **Secondary Storage:** Non-volatile storage (e.g., hard disks, SSDs).

## 3. OS Services and System Calls

**Services Provided by the OS:**
- **Program Execution:** Load and run programs.
- **I/O Operations:** Manage input/output operations.
- **File-System Manipulation:** Manage files and directories.
- **Interprocess Communication (IPC):** Share data between processes.
- **Error Handling, Resource Allocation, Accounting, Protection, and Security.**

**System Calls:**
- Interface to the services provided by the OS.
- Common APIs: Win32 API (Windows), POSIX API (UNIX/Linux).

**Example of File System Calls:**
```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int fd;
    char buffer[100];

    // Open a file
    fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("Open failed");
        return 1;
    }

    // Read from the file
    ssize_t bytesRead = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    if (bytesRead < 0) {
        perror("Read failed");
        return 1;
    }

    // Close the file
    close(fd);

    return 0;
}
```

**Trapping to the Kernel:**
- User process calls a system call wrapper function.
- Wrapper issues a low-level trap instruction to switch from user mode to kernel mode.

## 4. OS Architecture

**Traditional UNIX:**
- Monolithic kernel with all OS functions compiled into one level.

**Modular Kernel:**
- Core components as separate modules.
- More flexible than monolithic kernels.

**Microkernel:**
- Moves non-essential components to user space.
- Benefits: Easier to develop and port, more reliable and secure.
- Drawbacks: Performance overhead of user-space to kernel-space communication.

## 5. Virtual Machines

**Concept:**
- Allows running one OS (guest) on another OS (host).
- Provides an interface identical to the underlying hardware.

**Benefits:**
- Multiple execution environments on the same hardware.
- Useful for development, testing, and consolidating low-resource systems.

**Example of Virtual Machine Architecture:**
```text
Host OS
  +-- Hypervisor (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox)
       +-- Guest OS 1 (e.g., Windows)
       +-- Guest OS 2 (e.g., Linux)
```

## 6. Device Drivers

**Device Controllers:**
- Hardware connecting to external devices, managed by the OS through device drivers.

**Linux Device Drivers:**
- Software allowing programs to interface with external devices.
- Special files in `/dev` for devices.
- Functions: `open`, `read`, `write`, `ioctl`, `close`.


**Handling Interrupts in Device Drivers:**
- **Top Half:** Directly called by the interrupt handler, transfers data between device and kernel buffer.
- **Bottom Half:** Processes the rest of the interrupt, such as protocol handling and waking up processes.
