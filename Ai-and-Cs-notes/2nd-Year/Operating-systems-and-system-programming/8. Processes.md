# Process Management

Process management is a fundamental part of operating systems, dealing with the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes. Understanding these concepts is crucial for grasping how an OS efficiently manages system resources and ensures smooth execution of multiple programs.

## 1. Process Concept

**Definition:**
A process is a program in execution, which includes the program code, current activity represented by the value of the program counter, and the contents of the processor's registers.

**Components of a Process:**
- Program (text)
- Program Counter (PC)
- Stack
- Data Section
- Heap

## 2. Process States and Control Block

### Process States:
- **New:** The process is being created.
- **Running:** Instructions are being executed.
- **Waiting:** The process is waiting for some event.
- **Ready:** The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
- **Terminated:** The process has finished execution.

### Process Control Block (PCB):
Contains process state, program counter, CPU registers, CPU scheduling information, memory-management information, accounting information, and I/O status information.

## 3. Process Creation and Termination

### Process Creation:
- **Parent processes create child processes, forming a process tree.**
- Processes are identified by a process identifier (pid).

**Resource Sharing:**
- Parent and children share all resources.
- Children share a subset of parentâ€™s resources.
- Parent and child share no resources.

### Process Termination:
- **Process executes last statement and asks the OS to delete it (exit).**
- Parent may terminate the execution of child processes (abort).

## 4. Context Switching

**Context Switch:**
When the CPU switches to another process, the system must save the state of the old process and load the saved state for the new process.

**Note:** Context-switch time is overhead and does not contribute to productive work.

## 5. Scheduling Queues and Workflow

**Scheduling Queues:**
- **Job Queue:** Set of all processes in the system.
- **Ready Queue:** Set of all processes residing in main memory, ready to execute.
- **Device Queues:** Set of processes waiting for an I/O device.

## 6. Scheduling Algorithms

### CPU Scheduling:
**Key function of the OS to manage process execution.**

**Scheduling Criteria:**
- **CPU utilization:**
  The percentage of time the CPU is actively working on processes, as opposed to being idle.
- **Throughput:**
  The number of processes that complete their execution per unit of time.
- **Turnaround time:**
  The total time taken for a process to complete, from the moment it is submitted to the moment it finishes execution.
- **Waiting time:**
  The total time a process spends in the ready queue waiting to be assigned to the CPU.
- **Response time:**
  The time from the submission of a request until the first response is produced, not the completion of the process.

### Common Scheduling Algorithms:
- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):**
  Simple but can cause long waiting times.
- **Shortest Job First (SJF):**
  Optimal in terms of minimum average waiting time but hard to predict next burst time.
- **Priority Scheduling:**
  Processes are assigned priorities. Risk of starvation for low-priority processes, a solution is aging of old processes "increase their priority over time".
- **Round-Robin (RR):**
  Preemted FCFS, Each process gets a small unit of CPU time (time quantum). Suitable for time-sharing systems.

### Advanced Scheduling Techniques:
- **Multilevel Queue Scheduling:**
  Separate queues for different process types (e.g., system, interactive).
- **Multiprocessor Scheduling:**
  Load balancing across multiple CPUs, processor affinity.

**Processor Affinity:**
- **Soft Affinity:** Preference for the current CPU.
- **Hard Affinity:** Binding to a specific CPU.

**Load Balancing:**
- **Push Migration:** Periodically move processes to less loaded CPUs.
- **Pull Migration:** Idle CPUs pull processes from busy CPUs.
