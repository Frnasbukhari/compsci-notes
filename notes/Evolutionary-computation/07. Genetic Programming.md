## 1. Introduction to Genetic Programming

### 1.1 What is Genetic Programming?
Genetic Programming is a technique for automatic programming that evolves computer programs to solve problems.
It is inspired by biological evolution and uses mechanisms such as selection, crossover, and mutation.

#### Two Views of GP:
- **Content View (Automatic Programming):**
  - **Focus:** Automatically generating programs through evolution.
  - **Key Idea:** The process creates programs from scratch using a variety of representations.
- **Representation View:**
  - **Focus:** Using tree-based (or other) structures to represent solutions.
  - **Key Idea:** Even if the representation isn’t traditional code, it can still serve as a “program” if it solves the problem.

### 1.2 Applications of Genetic Programming
GP has been successfully applied in many domains, including:
- **Regression Problems:** Finding mathematical functions that fit data.
- **Control Systems:** Evolving controllers for robots, plants, or spacecraft.
- **Design and Optimization:** Developing neural networks, electronic circuits, and more.
- **Data Mining & Classification:** Automating the discovery of patterns in large datasets.

## 2. Representing Programs in Evolutionary Computation

### 2.1 Tree Representation
- **Concept:** Programs are represented as trees, similar to LISP expressions.
- **Structure:**
  - **Nodes:** Represent functions or operators.
  - **Leaves (Terminal Nodes):** Represent inputs (sensors, variables) or constants.
- **Mechanics:**
  - Uses a local data storage mechanism (often a stack) for intermediate computations.
  - Employs tree-specific genetic operators such as subtree crossover.

*Example:* In a symbolic regression task, a tree might have internal nodes for operators like `+` or `*` and leaves for variables (e.g., `x`) or numeric constants.

### 2.2 Linear Representation
- **Concept:** Programs are encoded as a sequence (or list) of instructions.
- **Mechanics:**
  - Utilizes registers for data storage, resembling the operations of a machine (e.g., Von Neumann architecture).
  - Genetic operators include variable-length crossover and mutation (insertion, deletion, or replacement of instructions).

### 2.3 Graph Representation
- **Concept:** Programs are represented as graphs where nodes correspond to operations and edges dictate the flow of control.
- **Mechanics:**
  - Nodes perform operations, and edges determine the order of execution.
  - Uses a stack (LIFO) to manage data, and edges can incorporate control-flow conditions (e.g., if a value is less than, equal to, or greater than zero).

*Note:* This representation is especially useful when the program’s logic is naturally expressed as a flow of operations, such as in control systems.

## 3. Example Problem: Symbolic Regression

**Symbolic Regression** is a common problem in GP:
- **Goal:** Given a set of data points, find a mathematical function that approximates the underlying relationship.
- **Application Areas:** Statistics, process engineering, and scientific research.

### 3.1 Tree Representation for Symbolic Regression
Two important components are defined for constructing the trees:

#### Function Set
- **Definition:** A set of operations (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `log`) that combine variables and constants.
- **Requirement:** Functions must be defined for all possible inputs (e.g., handling division by zero).

#### Terminal Set
- **Definition:** The basic building blocks (arity 0) for the program.
- **Includes:**
  - **Inputs:** Variables, sensor data.
  - **Constants:** Numeric values (although not every possible constant is supplied, they are chosen based on the problem context).

## 4. Genetic Operators

Evolution in GP is driven by operators that modify the program representations.

### 4.1 Crossover

Crossover combines parts from two parent programs to create offspring.

#### 4.1.1 Branch Swap (Subtree Crossover)
- **Process:**
  1. Select a random branch (subtree) from each parent.
  2. Swap these branches between the parents.
- **Illustration:**  
  ![Subtree Crossover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming#/media/File:Genetic_programming_subtree_crossover.gif)
- **Benefit:** This operator recombines building blocks from different individuals, potentially leading to better solutions.

#### 4.1.2 Match 1-Point Crossover
- **Process:**
  1. **Selection:** Two parent trees are chosen based on fitness.
  2. **Matching:** Starting at the root, traverse both trees and match branches that have the same arity.
  3. **Subtree Exchange:** Swap these matched subtrees.
- **Explanation:** Matching similar structures can help maintain the functional integrity of offspring.

### 4.2 Mutation

Mutation introduces random changes to a program to explore new solutions.

#### 4.2.1 Branch Replacement Mutation
- **Process:**
  1. Select a random branch from a parent tree.
  2. Delete the selected branch.
  3. Replace it with a newly generated random branch (using the same process as initial population creation).
- **Illustration:**  
  ![Mutation Example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming#/media/File:Genetic_programming_mutation.gif)
- **Benefit:** Helps introduce new genetic material and prevents premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.

## 5. Creation of the Initial Population

A diverse initial population is essential for effectively exploring the search space.

### 5.1 Full Method
- **Steps:**
  1. Fix the tree depth (`treeDepth`).
  2. Fill the tree with random function nodes until every branch reaches `treeDepth - 1`.
  3. Append terminal nodes at the end of each branch.
- **Outcome:** A uniform population where every tree has the same fixed depth.

### 5.2 Growth Method
- **Steps:**
  1. Set a maximum tree depth (`maxDepth`).
  2. Randomly choose to add either a function or terminal node until each branch either terminates or reaches `maxDepth - 1`.
  3. Ensure every branch that isn’t terminated ends with a terminal.
- **Outcome:** More varied tree structures compared to the full method.

### 5.3 Ramped Half-and-Half
- **Steps:**
  1. For depths from 2 up to `maxDepth`, create two groups:
     - **Half:** Individuals generated using the growth method.
     - **Half:** Individuals generated using the full method.
  2. Distribute the total population size evenly among these depth levels.
- **Outcome:** A population with a range of tree sizes and shapes, increasing diversity.

## 6. Bloat in Genetic Programming

**Bloat** refers to the uncontrolled growth of program size without corresponding improvements in performance.

### 6.1 Causes of Bloat
- **Uneven Crossover:** Some parts of the tree may grow excessively.
- **Unused Code:** Sections that do not affect the final output can accumulate.

### 6.2 Consequences of Bloat
- Slower execution due to larger program sizes.
- Increased demand for storage and CPU time.
- Reduced efficiency in genetic operations (mutation, crossover on code that does not affect output).

### 6.3 Countermeasures
- **Fitness Penalization:** Incorporate program size into the fitness function to penalize overly large solutions.
- **Specialized Operators:** Use crossover operators (like matched one-point crossover) that control size growth.

## 7. Alternative Representations in Genetic Programming

Beyond tree representations, GP can employ other forms, such as linear and graph representations.

### 7.1 Linear Representation Genetic Programming
- **Concept:** Programs are encoded as a sequence of instructions.
- **Mechanics:**
  - Similar to register machine programming (e.g., Von Neumann architecture).
  - Operates on a string of instructions with registers for data storage.
- **Genetic Operators:** Use variable-length one-point and two-point crossover, and mutation operations that may replace, add, or delete instructions.
- **Example:** A program might be a list of commands like “load register 1,” “add register 2,” etc.

### 7.2 Graph Representation Genetic Programming
- **Concept:** Uses graph structures where nodes represent operations.
- **Mechanics:**
  - A stack (Last-In, First-Out) is used for managing intermediate results.
  - Edges determine control flow, with decisions based on conditions (e.g., `< 0`, `= 0`, `> 0`).
  - Allows the natural expression of loops and recursion.
- **Specialized Operators:** Mutation and crossover are adapted to handle graph structures.
- **Example:** A graph-based program may include nodes that perform arithmetic operations and edges that represent conditional jumps.

## 8. Evolving Graphs by Graph Programming (EGGP)

EGGP is a specialized approach proposed in 2018 by researchers at York University.

### 8.1 Graph Representation in EGGP
- **Structure:** Individuals are represented as Acyclic Directed Graphs (DAGs).
- **Components:**
  - **Input Nodes:** Represent the problem’s inputs.
  - **Output Nodes:** Represent the outputs of the program.
  - **Function Nodes:** Perform mathematical or logical operations.
- **Function Node Connections:**
  - Each function node with an arity `a(f)` has exactly `a(f)` outgoing edges.
  - The outgoing edges are ordered and labeled, which defines how the node processes its inputs.

### 8.2 Key Concepts in EGGP
- **Output Node Constraints:**
  - Each output node has exactly one outgoing edge.
  - Output nodes have no incoming edges, ensuring clear separation between processing and final output.
- **Acyclic Graphs (DAGs):**
  - The use of DAGs means that inputs (leaves) flow toward outputs (roots) without forming cycles.
- **Neutral Nodes and Drift:**
  - **Neutral Nodes:** Nodes that are not connected to any output; they do not affect the program’s behavior.
  - **Neutral Drift:** The process where neutral mutations accumulate over time. Although these changes do not affect the current output, they can provide hidden diversity that may become useful later.

### 8.3 EGGP Example
- **Scenario:**  
  Imagine a graph with:
  - One output node (`o1`).
  - Two input nodes (`i1` and `i2`).
  - Several additional (neutral) nodes that do not impact the final output.
- **Illustration:** A function node might compute `i1 - i2` where the two outgoing edges define the operands. Edge ordering is critical to ensure correct operation.
