# From Supervised Models to Human‑in‑the‑Loop  
*A practical roadmap for building AI systems that work*

These notes walk you step‑by‑step from the basic idea of “learning from labeled data” to the organisational and ethical questions that come up when you ship models to production.  
Each section starts with a brief **Why it matters** paragraph so you always know how the pieces fit together.

## 1. What is Supervised Learning and Why Should I Care?

**Why it matters**  
Every recommendation you click, email filter you rely on, or credit‑risk score that decides a loan was trained using supervised learning. Understanding the basics lets you judge whether a project is even feasible and what data you have to collect.

**The core idea** – show the algorithm many examples **with the answer attached** so it can learn a rule that generalises.

| Task flavour | Goal | Typical examples |
|--------------|------|------------------|
| **Classification** | Put items into buckets | spam vs. ham, disease vs. healthy |
| **Regression** | Predict a number | house price, sales next week |

> **Executive takeaway:** Traditional rule‑based systems crumble as complexity grows; supervised models learn the rules automatically and improve as you feed them more data.

## 2. Judging Performance: Reading the Dashboard

**Why it matters**  
A model that looks great on your laptop can crash and burn in production. Performance metrics tell you *where* it fails and *how* to fix it.

**Key metrics**

| Metric | Plain English question it answers |
|---|---|
| **Accuracy** | *Overall*, how often are we right? |
| **Precision** | When we say **Yes**, how often is that correct? |
| **Recall** | Out of all the real **Yes** cases, how many did we find? |
| **F1‑Score** | One‑number compromise between Precision and Recall |

*Common pitfalls*

- **Underfitting:** model too simple ➜ misses patterns.  
- **Overfitting:** model memorises noise ➜ fails on new data.  
Use a **hold‑out test set** and compare train vs. test scores early to spot both.

## 3. Neural Architectures: Choosing the Right Tool

**Why it matters**  
Neural networks come in many shapes. Picking the wrong one is like hammering in screws.

### 3.1 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — *seeing patterns in pixels*

- Treat an image as a grid; **convolutions** scan for edges, textures, shapes.  
- **Pooling** shrinks the data while keeping the strongest signals.  
- A **fully‑connected head** turns extracted features into the final prediction.

> Use for images, video frames, or even text arranged as a “pixel map”.

### 3.2 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) — *remembering sequences*

- Pass a hidden state from step to step so earlier words influence later ones.  
- Trained by **Back‑propagation Through Time (BPTT)**.  
- Watch out for **exploding** or **vanishing** gradients.

### 3.3 Long Short‑Term Memory (LSTM) — *memory with valves*

Adds gates that decide what to remember, forget, and expose, solving the gradient problems.

| Data type | Go‑to network | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Images / video | **CNN** | Exploits spatial locality |
| Text, speech, sensors | **LSTM / GRU** | Captures long‑range order |
| Very short, real‑time sequences | **Vanilla RNN** | Lightweight |

## 4. Keeping Humans in the Loop

**Why it matters**  
Models drift, regulations evolve, and edge cases bite. Human expertise keeps the system safe and useful.

| Approach | Human does | Good when |
|---|---|---|
| **Active Learning** | Labels only the confusing examples | Labels are expensive |
| **Interactive ML** | Tweaks model live via UI | Fast iteration needed |
| **Machine Teaching** | Curates a teaching curriculum | Very little data |
| **Curriculum Learning** | Feeds easy ➜ hard examples | Training is unstable |
| **Explainable AI** | Reviews model reasoning | Trust or compliance required |

## 5. Usable, Useful & Trustworthy AI

**Why it matters**  
A model that no one trusts or can’t legally deploy is dead on arrival.

- **Usable** → fits the tech stack and user workflow.  
- **Useful** → solves the real business pain.  
- **Trustworthy** → robust, fair, private, explainable.

Ask yourself: *Would I bet my bonus on this prediction?*

## 6. Trends on the Horizon

**Why it matters**  
Today’s prototype is tomorrow’s legacy system. Planning ahead saves rewrites.

1. **Domain‑first thinking** – start with the problem, not the algorithm.  
2. **AutoML & MLOps** – automate the drudge work, version everything.  
3. **Human‑centred design** – empower subject‑matter experts, not just ML engineers.  
4. **Ethics & regulation** – trust becomes a competitive edge, not a tick‑box.

## 7. Quick‑Start Checklist

1. Define the **business outcome** and success metric.  
2. **Collect / label data** (consider Active Learning if labels are scarce).  
3. Build a **simple baseline**; learn what matters.  
4. Upgrade to **CNN/LSTM** only if the payoff is clear.  
5. Add **human feedback loops** and **explainability hooks**.  
6. Monitor, retrain, and audit each release.

> **Bottom line:** Great AI blends solid data, the right architecture, and continuous human oversight.
