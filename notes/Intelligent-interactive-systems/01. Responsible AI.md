## 1. Intelligent Interactive Systems

### Definition and Scope
- **Intelligent Interactive Systems** are software or technological systems that:
  - **Perceive** their environment and/or user inputs.
  - **Act** (often in real time) in ways that are adaptive or goal-directed.
  - **Engage in cognitive processing** to understand and potentially anticipate user intentions.
- They are **not** meant to be Artificial General Intelligence (AGI); rather, they focus on specific cooperative or interactive tasks.

### Key Elements of Interaction
- **Interaction**: Involves a genuine exchange or “discourse” with the user.  
  - The system should understand the user’s goals, respond appropriately, and adapt over time.
  - This includes **cooperation** or **collaboration** with human users.
  - Interaction can occur on multiple timescales:
    1. **Immediate perception-action** (e.g., reacting to a user’s click or voice command).
    2. **Conversational** exchanges (text or speech-based).
    3. **Higher-level decision-making** (longer-term goals and preferences).
- **Co-adaptive Setting**: Estimating a user’s intentions is dynamic—both user and system may adapt in response to each other’s actions (e.g., a penalty taker vs. a goalie in sports).

### Intelligence and Rationality
- **Rational choices**: Intelligence here means making the best possible choice given data and an objective.
- Systems rely on **models of human psychology** that:
  - Have **explanatory power** (they explain user behavior).
  - Have **predictive power** (they anticipate future actions or preferences).
  - Are **consistent across contexts**.
  - Align with other relevant scientific models.

### Learning Outcomes (Course-Level)
By engaging with Intelligent Interactive Systems, one should be able to:
1. **Conceptualize** a broad variety of intelligent interactive systems and understand their structure.
2. Appreciate how **human psychology** informs design choices.
3. **Build software** models enabling human-computer cooperation.
4. **Analyze and solve** new design problems, from conceptualization to programming solutions.

## 2. Responsible AI

This section explores modern AI developments, particularly **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, while highlighting major challenges like bias and misinformation.

### Generative AI and Large Language Models
- **Generative AI** can produce new content—text, images, audio, video—by learning patterns from large datasets.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** (e.g., GPT-style models) predict the next word in a sequence, but do not “understand” meaning as humans do.  
  - They are trained on vast corpora of text, learning statistical relationships between words.

### Foundations of Neural Networks
1. **Perceptrons**  
   - Early neuron-inspired models that compute weighted sums of inputs.  
   - Limited (e.g., cannot learn XOR).
2. **Multilayer Perceptrons**  
   - Add hidden layers, use backpropagation to train on labeled data.  
   - The backbone of deeper architectures.
3. **Deep Learning Revolution** (post-2010)  
   - Driven by large datasets, more compute power (GPUs), and specialized architectures like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for images.

### Word Embeddings
- **One-hot encoding**: Simple but sparse representation (each word as a huge vector mostly full of zeros).
- **Word2Vec** (Mikolov, 2013):  
  - Learns dense embeddings where similar words are close in vector space.  
  - Methods include **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)** and **Skip-gram**.

### RNNs and Transformers
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**  
  - Handle sequences by updating internal states word by word.  
  - Often suffer from vanishing gradients, making deep training harder.
- **Transformers**  
  - Rely on **attention mechanisms**, processing sequences in parallel rather than step by step.  
  - Enable state-of-the-art NLP performance, powering modern LLMs.

### Major Challenges in LLMs
1. **Bias**  
   - Data reflect societal biases (sexism, racism, etc.).  
   - LLMs can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify these biases.
2. **Hallucinations**  
   - LLMs can “make up” plausible but false information.  
   - They are not inherently “grounded” in external facts.
3. **Adversarial Attacks**  
   - “Jailbreaking” LLMs through malicious prompts or hacks to bypass safeguards.
4. **Data Privacy & Security**  
   - Large datasets may contain sensitive user information.

### Mitigation and Improvements
- **Retrieval Assisted Generation (RAG)**  
  - Combines LLMs with document retrieval to ensure generated text aligns with verified information.
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback**  
  - Adjust model outputs based on evaluative feedback from humans.
- **Guard Rails & Prompt Engineering**  
  - Carefully design prompts to reduce inappropriate outputs.  
  - Add policy layers and usage guidelines.
- **Transparency & Auditing**  
  - “Transparency by design” fosters accountability.  
  - **Independent audits** can help uncover biases and vulnerabilities.
- **Technical Innovations**  
  - Watermarking generated content.  
  - New approaches to verifying or constraining outputs.

## 3. Ethics of AI

While responsible AI focuses on practical measures (like bias reduction and technical fixes), **AI Ethics** tackles broader social, moral, and systemic questions.

### Current AI Ethics Guidelines
- A **proliferation** of guidelines has emerged from corporations, governments, and NGOs.
- Common themes:
  - **Privacy, fairness, accountability, transparency, safety, cybersecurity,** and serving the **common good**.
- **Major critique**  
  - These guidelines often lack enforcement or legal backing.  
  - They can be used to forestall tighter regulation or provide public relations benefits without ensuring real change.

### Recurring Gaps
1. **Lack of Implementation**  
   - Little research on how to translate ethical goals into everyday practice in AI labs and companies.
2. **Justice vs. Care Ethics**  
   - Most guidelines emphasize “male-oriented” justice ethics (rules, accountability, metrics).  
   - They overlook “care ethics” that focus on nurture, welfare, social responsibility, or ecological concerns.
3. **Omissions**  
   - **Political abuse of AI** (bots, fake news, surveillance).  
   - **Diversity** in the AI community (both in developers and impacted groups).  
   - **Ecological and hidden social costs** (lithium mining, e-waste, low-wage “clickworkers”).  
   - **Public-private partnerships** and industry-driven research agendas.

### Business vs. Ethics
- **Profit motives** and the international “AI race” frequently overshadow ethical considerations.
- Fear of “falling behind” can diminish willingness to impose ethical constraints.

### Effectiveness and the Need for Change
- Studies show **weak influence** of guidelines on the day-to-day decisions of AI practitioners.
- **System Theory** perspective  
  - Different societal systems (business, research, ethics) operate under separate logics.  
  - Ethics guidelines have limited power to modify entrenched commercial or competitive incentives.
- Many ethical goals remain **underachieved**, for instance:
  - Privacy is still threatened by large-scale data collection.  
  - Gender diversity in AI remains low.  
  - Autonomy and social cohesion are challenged by automated propaganda and algorithmic control.

### A Path Forward
1. **Microethics**  
   - Ethics must engage with the actual technical details—how data is gathered, curated, processed, and how code is designed.
2. **Virtue Ethics**  
   - Augment deontological (rule-based) approaches with a focus on moral character, virtues (honesty, empathy, care), and situation-sensitive judgment.
3. **Legal & Structural Support**  
   - Stronger regulatory frameworks and institutions for auditing and complaint resolution.
   - **Education**: Incorporate ethics of technology, media, and information into broader curricula.
