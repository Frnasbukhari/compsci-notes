# Introduction to Recommender Systems
A **Recommender System (RS)** —*a program that filters information for a user based on what it knows about that user*— predicts what each person will probably like and presents those items.

## 1. Why We Need Them
- **Information Overload** —*too many choices to sift through manually*.  
- **Personalization** —*tailoring results to one person instead of the average crowd*.  
- **Data-Driven Decisions** —*using past behavior to guide future suggestions*.  
- **Business Impact**: 35 % of Amazon sales, 75 % of Netflix views, and 70 % of YouTube watch time stem from RS output.

## 2. Core Concepts & Terminology

| Technical Term | Plain-English Meaning |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| **User Model** | Facts the system knows about a person (ratings, clicks, demographics). |
| **Item** | Anything that can be recommended (movie, article, product). |
| **Utility Function** | Math rule that scores how much a user may like an item. |
| **Long Tail** | Niche items that only a few people want but add up to many sales collectively. |

## 3. Main Types of Recommender Systems

1. **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** —*learns from the wisdom of the crowd*.  
2. **Content-Based (CB)** —*learns from the description of each item*.  
3. **Hybrid Methods** —*combine CF and CB to offset individual weaknesses*.  
4. **Knowledge-Based** —*use explicit rules or domain facts (e.g., “must fit my camera”) when data are sparse*.

## 4. Collaborative Filtering (CF)

### 4.1 How It Works  
CF assumes **“people with similar taste in the past will like similar things in the future.”**

#### Two Flavors  
| Approach | What It Does | Key Similarity Metric |
|----------|--------------|-----------------------|
| **User-Based CF** —*find neighbors that rate like me* | Predicts my rating from ratings of similar users. | **Pearson Correlation** —*compares rating patterns while normalizing for rating habits*. |
| **Item-Based CF** —*find siblings of what I liked* | Looks at items similar to those I already rated. | **Cosine Similarity** —*measures angle between item vectors*. |

#### Ratings  
- **Explicit Ratings** —*stars, thumbs-up*: precise but hard to collect.  
- **Implicit Ratings** —*clicks, purchases*: easy but noisy.

### 4.2 CF Pain Points  
| Issue | Plain English |
|-------|---------------|
| **Cold Start** | No history for a new user or new item. |
| **Data Sparsity** | Ratings matrix mostly empty. |
| **Scalability** | Matrix math gets heavy for millions of users/items. |
| **Popularity & Demographic Bias** | System over-promotes trendy or majority-group items. |

## 5. Content-Based Recommendation (CB)

### 5.1 How It Works  
CB matches **item features** (e.g., genre, keywords) with a **user profile** built from items the user liked.

### 5.2 Representing Content  
- **TF–IDF (Term-Frequency × Inverse-Document-Frequency)** —*scores how important a word is in an item compared to the whole collection*.  
- **Vector Space Model** —*treats each item as a point in multi-dimensional word space*.

### 5.3 Learning User Preferences  
- **Nearest-Neighbor Search** —*pick items closest to the user’s vector*.  
- **Probabilistic & Machine-Learning Models** —*Bayes, Linear Classifier, Decision Trees, Rule Induction* convert text into hot/cold classes.

### 5.4 Limitations  
- **Overspecialization** —*keeps recommending “more of the same.”*  
- **Sparse or Non-Text Content** —*hard to extract features from images or short blurbs.*  
- **Ramp-Up Time** —*needs some initial likes to learn the profile.*

## 6. Hybrid & Knowledge-Based Approaches
- **Hybrid Systems** blend CF and CB (e.g., mixing scores or switching logic) to reduce cold start and bias.  
- **Knowledge-Based RS** leverage domain rules or constraints when data are scarce (e.g., travel recommender requiring dates, budget).

## 7. Evaluating Success

| Perspective | Goal | Typical Metric |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| **Retrieval** —*help users find what they already want* | Lower search cost | Precision / Recall |
| **Prediction** —*guess explicit ratings* | Accuracy | RMSE, MAE |
| **Recommendation** —*deliver serendipity* | Novelty & Diversity | Coverage, Long-Tail Hit Rate |
| **Interaction** —*feel good UX* | Engagement | Dwell Time |
| **Conversion** —*drive business* | Revenue | Click-Through, Sales Margin |

## 8. Current Trends & Research Directions

1. **Personalization 2.0** —fine-grained profiles that evolve in real time.  
2. **Explainable AI** —show *why* something is recommended.  
3. **Context-Aware RS** —use time, location, social context.  
4. **Multi-Stakeholder Optimization** —balance user joy, creator exposure, and platform profit.  
5. **Ethics, Fairness & Bias Mitigation** —ensure diverse and privacy-respecting suggestions.  
6. **Reinforcement Learning** —treat recommendations as sequential decisions.  
7. **Long-Term User Modeling** —capture drifting tastes.  
8. **Novel Paradigms** —e.g., group, cross-domain, conversational RS.

## 10. Key Takeaways
- RS filter massive choice lists into personalized shortlists.  
- CF exploits crowd wisdom but fights cold start and popularity bias.  
- CB uses item descriptions; great for niche items but risks monotony.  
- Hybrids and knowledge-based models combine strengths.  
- Evaluation must match the real-world goal (accuracy ≠ usefulness).  
- Modern RS research focuses on transparency, context, fairness, and learning over time.
