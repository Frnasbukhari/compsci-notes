## 1. Understanding the Nature of Data

<img src="../../images/nature_of_data.png" alt="Nature of Data" width="800">

Data comes in many forms—signals, images, videos, text, etc.—but from a mathematical perspective, all data can be represented as **points in space**. This abstraction enables us to apply consistent mathematical techniques across different data types.

### Key Insights:
- **Points in Space**: Regardless of format, all data can be treated as points in a structured set or space. For example, an image can be represented as a matrix of pixel values, and a video as a sequence of such matrices over time.
- **Human-Defined Semantics**: The meaning (semantics) of the data is determined by humans. For example, the same numeric data might represent temperature in Celsius, income in dollars, or votes in an election.
- **Representation Matters**: The way data is stored and manipulated (its representation) affects convenience but not its mathematical properties. Choosing the right representation is crucial for efficient analysis.

## 2. Data as Points in Space

### 2.1 Sets and Elements
A **set** is a collection of distinct objects, called elements. Sets are fundamental because they form the basis for organizing data:
- **Finite Sets**: Contain a limited number of elements (e.g., a set of colors: `{red, green, blue}`).
- **Infinite Sets**: Contain an unlimited number of elements (e.g., the set of all integers).

In data analysis, we can represent almost any type of data as a set:
- Text: A set of words in a document.
- Image: A set of pixel values arranged spatially.
- Video: A set of images (frames) ordered in time.

---

### 2.2 Manipulating Sets
Manipulating sets allows us to extract relationships and insights:
- **Operations**: Include union, intersection, and difference. For example, combining datasets is a union, while finding common entries is an intersection.
- **Relations**: Describe connections between elements. These are the "verbs" in mathematics:
  - Example: "2 plus 2 equals 4" relates numbers in a mathematical operation.
  - Example: "Alice owns a cat" relates a person and an animal in a logical sense.

---

### 2.3 Cartesian Product
The Cartesian product combines sets into a single set of ordered pairs (or tuples):
- **Definition**: If \( A = \{1, 2\} \) and \( B = \{x, y\} \), then:
  \[
  A x B = \{(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y)\}
  \]
- **Application**:
  - In multivariate data, a Cartesian product helps represent combinations of variables like height and weight.
  - In machine learning, feature spaces are often Cartesian products of multiple input dimensions.

### 2.4 Types of Relations

Relations are fundamental concepts in data analysis and mathematics, describing how elements of sets interact. These relations are subsets of Cartesian products and can have specific constraints. There are **five key types of relations**:

1. **Functions**:
   - **Definition**: A relation where each input (element from the domain) maps to **at most one output** (element from the range).
   - **Example**: \( f(x) = x^2 \), where every input \( x \) has exactly one output \( x^2 \).
   - **Application**: Functions are used in modeling relationships between variables, such as predicting house prices based on square footage.

2. **Orders**:
   - **Definition**: A relation that is **reflexive, transitive, and anti-symmetric**
   - **Application**: Orders are useful for sorting and ranking tasks, such as prioritizing items in a queue.

3. **Equivalences**:
   - **Definition**: A relation that is **reflexive, transitive, and symmetric**
   - **Application**: Equivalences are used to group data into **equivalence classes**, such as clustering items based on similarity.

4. **Functors**:
   - **Definition**: A higher-level relation where the domain and codomain themselves consist of functions or mappings. Functors preserve structure between spaces.
   - **Example**: Mapping functions from one vector space to another while preserving linearity.
   - **Application**: Common in fields like machine learning and graph theory, where transformations between spaces or datasets need to maintain relationships.

5. **Operations**:
   - **Definition**: A relation applied to powers of a set, often combining multiple elements into one.
   - **Example**: Addition (\( + \)) is an operation on the set of numbers, combining two numbers to produce a third (\( a + b = c \)).
   - **Application**: Operations form the foundation of algebraic structures like groups, rings, and fields, enabling arithmetic and matrix computations.

### 2.5 Representations of Relations
Relations can be visualized in multiple ways:
- **Graph**: Nodes and edges depict relationships.
- **Adjacency Matrix**: A table shows whether elements are related.
- **Tuples**: Explicitly list related pairs.
and more...

<img src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Relations-and-Functions-1.png" alt="Relations" width="800">

These representations are key to data modeling in applications like social networks (graphs) or machine learning (feature matrices).

---

### 2.6 From Sets to Spaces
- **Spaces**: A space is a set where specific operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) are defined. For example:
  - A 2D plane is a space where points can be added or scaled.
  - A vector space supports advanced operations like projection and rotation.
- **Data as Points**: Data points in spaces allow us to compute distances, find clusters, or reduce dimensions.

## 3. Fundamentals of Data Analysis

### 3.1 Processing vs. Analysis
1. **Processing**:
   - Enhances or cleans data before analysis.
   - Example: Noise removal in a video or filtering missing values in a dataset.
2. **Analysis**:
   - Extracts summaries, patterns, or insights.
   - Example: Computing statistical metrics like averages or performing clustering.


### 3.2 Pipelines
A **pipeline** combines processing and analysis steps in sequence:
- Example: In text processing, a pipeline might involve tokenizing text, removing stop words, and applying sentiment analysis.
- **Key Rules**:
  - **Order Matters**: A step depends on the output of the previous one.
  - **Overprocessing Risks**: Excessive steps can remove useful data or distort results.

## 4. Properties of Sets

### 4.1 Key Definitions
- **Characteristic**: A trait or quality of an object (e.g., "red" is a characteristic of an apple).
- **Measurement**: Assigning labels to characteristics to enable comparison (e.g., height measured in centimeters).
- **Property**: A measurable characteristic (e.g., weight is a property of an object).

**Key Insight**: Properties connect data to their mathematical representation, forming the basis for analysis.

### 4.2 Intrinsic and Extrinsic Properties


#### 4.2.1 Intrinsic Properties
Intrinsic properties are built-in features of the data, independent of external context:
- **Cardinality**: How many elements are in a set.
  - Example: A set of colors like \{red, blue, green\} has a cardinality of 3.
- **Density**: Whether the data is discrete (individual points) or continuous (a smooth range).
  - Example: Whole numbers are discrete; real numbers are continuous.
- **Dimensionality**: The number of "axes" needed to describe the data.
  - Example: A 2D space requires length and width, while a 3D space also includes height.
- **Countability**: Whether you can list all elements in the set.
  - Example: The set of integers is countable, but the set of real numbers is uncountable.

#### 4.2.2 Extrinsic Properties
Extrinsic properties depend on **context or environment**:
- **Differentiability**: Whether the data changes smoothly.
  - Example: A curve is differentiable if it has no sharp edges.
- **Continuity**: Whether the data has gaps.
  - Example: A line with missing sections is not continuous.
- **Separability**: Whether you can distinguish groups in the data.
  - Example: Distinguishing cats and dogs in an image dataset depends on resolution and clarity.

While extrinsic properties seem tied to the data, their realization or perception depends on external factors like:
1. Measurement tools (e.g., sensor precision, noise levels).
2. Sampling processes (e.g., gaps from missing observations).
3. Context of analysis (e.g., resolution or algorithm choices).

## 5. Variables and Descriptive Statistics

### 5.1 Variables
Variables define relationships between data elements:
- **Nominal**: Categories without order (e.g., types of fruits).
- **Ordinal**: Ordered categories (e.g., ranks: gold, silver, bronze).
- **Interval**: Quantitative data with no true zero (e.g., temperature).
- **Ratio**: Quantitative data with a true zero (e.g., weight).

---

### 5.2 Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics summarize data:
1. **Central Tendency**:
   - **Mean**: The average of the values.
   - **Median**: The middle value when sorted.
   - **Mode**: The most frequent value.
2. **Dispersion**:
   - **Variance**: Measures how spread out the data is.
   - **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance; shows the average deviation from the mean.

Example: For the data \([1, 2, 2, 3, 4]\):
- Mean = \( (1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 5 = 2.4 \)
- Median = \( 2 \) (middle value)
- Mode = \( 2 \) (most frequent)

## 6. Signals and Noise

### 6.1 Signals
- **Definition**: Structured data representing observations over time or space.
- **Key Property**: The order of observations matters. For example:
  - A heartbeat signal shows regular patterns over time.
  - Rearranging the order destroys the information.

---

### 6.2 Noise and Descriptors
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: Measures the strength of the signal relative to background noise.
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: Indicates variability relative to the mean.

**Types of Noise**:
1. **White Noise**: Random with equal intensity across frequencies.
2. **Pink Noise**: More power at lower frequencies.
3. **Gaussian Noise**: Follows a normal distribution.
