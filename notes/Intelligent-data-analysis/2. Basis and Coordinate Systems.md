## 1. Basis and Coordinate Systems

### 1.1 What is a Basis?
A **basis** is a set of functions or vectors that allows every element of a vector space to be expressed **uniquely** as a linear combination of those basis elements. For example:

`v = Σ (ωᵢ * eᵢ)`

- `v`: An element in the vector space  
- `eᵢ`: Basis functions or vectors  
- `ωᵢ`: Coordinates (weights) in that basis  

**Dimension** is the number of basis functions.

> **Key Concept**  
> Every point in the space can be uniquely represented using a chosen basis, and the tuple `(ω₁, ω₂, …, ωₙ)` defines the coordinates of that point.

### 1.2 Examples of Coordinate Systems

#### 1.2.1 Canonical Basis in Euclidean Space
- For 2D space, `ℝ²`, the canonical basis is:  
  `{ (1, 0), (0, 1) }`

- **Example**: Represent the point `p = (2.5, 1.4)` as  
  `p = 2.5 * (1, 0) + 1.4 * (0, 1)`

#### 1.2.2 Argand Basis in Complex Plane
- Complex numbers:  
  `{ 1, i }`
- **Example**: `z = 1.8 + 3.2i` can be written as  
  `z = 1.8 * 1 + 3.2 * i`

#### 1.2.3 Orthogonal Unit Vectors in Physics
- In 3D Cartesian coordinates:  
  `{ î, ĵ, k̂ }`
- **Example**: `p = -1.6 î + 1.5 ĵ + 2.5 k̂`

> **Insight**  
> Coordinate systems allow us to represent elements uniquely, and the choice of basis can vary depending on the context or application.

### 1.3 Representing Signals Using Descriptors
Consider a set of signals defined by **amplitude** and **frequency**:

| Signal | Amplitude (A) | Frequency (F) |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| S1     | 1             | 1             |
| S2     | 2             | 1             |
| S3     | 1             | 2             |
| S4     | 2             | 2             |

**Dimension**: This set has 2 descriptors (amplitude, frequency).

`S1 = (1, 1)  
 S2 = (2, 1)  
 S3 = (1, 2)  
 S4 = (2, 2)`

*(Swapping or scaling descriptors changes representation but preserves uniqueness.)*

## 2. Decompositions in Data Analysis
Decompositions provide methods to express data in terms of **new basis functions** that simplify processing or analysis.

### 2.1 General Linear Model (GLM)
A GLM expresses relationships between variables as:  
`y = β₀ + β₁ x + ε`  
where `ε` is an error term.

**Solving GLM for Two Points**  
Given `(x₁, y₁)` and `(x₂, y₂)`:

```
β₁ = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁) β₀ = y₁ - β₁ * x₁
```


**Multivariate GLM** generalizes to multiple predictors:

`y = β₀ + ∑(βᵢ * xᵢ)`

Matrix form:

```
Y = X β + ε β = (Xᵀ X)⁻¹ Xᵀ Y
```


> **Geometric View**  
> A linear model `y = β₀ + β₁ x` can be seen as a point `(β₀, β₁)` in the space of all lines.

### 2.2 Fourier Analysis

**Definition**  
Decomposes a signal into a sum of sines and cosines:  
`f(t) = Σ [aₙ cos(nωt) + bₙ sin(nωt)]`

**Applications**  
- **Filtering**: Retain or remove certain frequencies  
- **Signal Reconstruction**: Recreate original signals from frequency components

**Example**  
`f(t) = sin(2πt) + (1/3) sin(6πt)`  
- Frequency components: `(1, 1/3)`  
- **Low-pass filter**: Could set the higher frequency component to 0

---

### 2.3 Wavelet Transform
**Definition**  
Represents signals using scaled and translated “wavelets”:  
`f(t) = Σ c₍k,n₎ Ψ(t; k, n)`

**Applications**  
- Spatiotemporal signal analysis  
- Denoising and compression

---

### 2.4 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
**Definition**  
A method that rotates data to align with directions of **maximum variance**. Often we first center the data:  
`X' = X - μ`

**Procedure**  
1. Center the data (subtract the mean).  
2. Compute the covariance matrix.  
3. Perform singular value decomposition (SVD) or eigen-decomposition.

**Dimensionality Reduction**  
Keep principal components with the largest eigenvalues (those explaining the most variance).

## 3. Manifold Embedding

### 3.1 What is a Manifold?
A **manifold** is a space that locally looks Euclidean but can have global curvature.

**Example**  
A sphere is locally flat but globally curved.

> **Applications in Data**  
> - Many high-dimensional datasets lie on a **lower-dimensional manifold**  
> - Methods like **t-SNE** or **Isomap** project data for visualization/analysis  
> - In **Machine Learning**, images (e.g., MNIST) often occupy a structured manifold

### 3.2 Applications
- **Dimensionality Reduction** (t-SNE, Isomap)  
- **Nonlinear Data Structure Representation**
