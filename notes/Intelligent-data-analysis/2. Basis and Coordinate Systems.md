# Week 2 Lecture: Nature of Data - Basis and Coordinate Systems

This lecture explores fundamental concepts related to data representation and analysis, focusing on basis, coordinate systems, and their application in data analysis.

## 1. Basis and Coordinate Systems

### 1.1 What is a Basis?
- A **basis** is a set of functions \( E = \{ e_i \in V \} \) that allows any element \( v \) in a vector space \( V \) to be uniquely expressed as a linear combination:
  \[
  v = \sum_{i} \omega_i e_i
  \]
- The **dimension** of the space is the number of basis functions.
- The tuple \( (\omega_1, \omega_2, \dots) \) is the **coordinate representation** of \( v \) in the chosen basis.

### 1.2 Examples of Basis Systems
- **Canonical Basis in Euclidean Space**: Standard unit vectors, e.g., in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \), \( \{(1, 0), (0, 1)\} \).
- **Argand Basis in Complex Plane**: Combines real and imaginary components, e.g., \( 1 \) and \( i \) in \( \mathbb{C} \).
- **Orthogonal Unit Vectors in Physics**: Commonly \( \hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k} \) for 3D Cartesian systems.

**Example**:
Represent point \( p = (2.5, 1.4) \) in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \):
\[
p = 2.5 \cdot (1, 0) + 1.4 \cdot (0, 1)
\]

### 1.3 Dimension of a Set
- The **dimension** of a set is the minimum number of descriptors needed to uniquely identify each element.
- For example, in a set of signals characterized by frequency and amplitude, the dimension is 2.

## 2. Decompositions and Coordinate Systems

### 2.1 General Linear Model (GLM)
- A GLM represents relationships between variables as linear models:
  \[
  y = \beta_1 x + \beta_0
  \]
- If there are \( n \) independent variables:
  \[
  y = \sum_{i=0}^n \beta_i x_i
  \]
  Here, \( \{x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n\} \) form a basis, and \( \beta_i \) are the coordinates in the space of all lines.

**Example**:
Fit a line to points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \):
\[
\beta_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}, \quad \beta_0 = y_1 - \beta_1 x_1
\]

### 2.2 Fourier Analysis
- Decomposes signals into sinusoidal components:
  \[
  f(t) = \sum_{n} c_n e^{j \omega_n t}
  \]
  or equivalently:
  \[
  f(t) = \sum_{n} \left( a_n \cos(\omega_n t) + b_n \sin(\omega_n t) \right)
  \]
- Applications: Signal filtering, spectral analysis.

**Example**:
For \( f(t) = \sin(2\pi t) + \frac{1}{3}\sin(6\pi t) \), the coefficients \( (1, \frac{1}{3}) \) represent the signal in the Fourier basis.

### 2.3 Wavelets
- Approximate signals using scaled and translated wave-like functions:
  \[
  f(t) = \sum_{k, n} c_{k,n} \Psi(t; k, n)
  \]
- Useful for analyzing non-stationary signals, denoising, and compression.

## 3. Manifold Embedding

### 3.1 What is a Manifold?
- A **manifold** is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space.
- Manifold embedding involves mapping data from a high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional one while preserving structure.

### 3.2 Applications in Machine Learning
- Dimensionality reduction, e.g., **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)** and **t-SNE**.
- Used for understanding complex data structures and visualizing high-dimensional datasets.

## 4. Final Remarks

### Key Takeaways
1. **Coordinate systems** enable representation of data points in different spaces.
2. **Decompositions** (e.g., Fourier, PCA) provide powerful tools for data analysis by changing the coordinate basis.
3. Choose the **right tool**:
   - GLM for regression.
   - Fourier for signal filtering.
   - Wavelets for spatiotemporal analysis.
   - PCA for dimensionality reduction.
   - Manifold learning for complex embeddings.

### Closing Formula
The universal data representation principle:
\[
p = \sum_{i} \omega_i e_i
\]
Every data analysis technique is a transformation in a chosen coordinate system.
