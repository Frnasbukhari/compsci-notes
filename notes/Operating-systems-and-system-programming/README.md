# Operating Systems and System Programming

Welcome to my notes for the *Operating Systems and System Programming* module! This repository contains a collection of concise, topic-focused Markdown files, each addressing core concepts of systems programming and the fundamentals of operating systems.

## Module Overview

The main objectives of this module are to:
- Introduce C programming fundamentals for systems-level development.
- Explain how operating systems manage resources, processes, and memory.
- Explore concurrency, synchronization techniques, and kernel-level programming.
- Provide practical insights into writing system-level code that interfaces closely with the OS.

By the end, you should have a solid grasp of operating system components, how they work under the hood, and how to leverage them effectively in real-world projects.

## Repository Structure
