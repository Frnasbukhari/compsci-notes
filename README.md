# compsci-notes

Welcome to my university notes repository! Here you’ll find a growing collection of notes, summaries, and study guides from my studies in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Computer Science** at the University of Birmingham. These notes reflect the modules I particularly enjoyed or found interesting—they’re not a complete record of every course I’ve taken. You might also notice that some modules are covered more comprehensively than others; in some cases, I’ve skipped topics that felt less relevant to me, and in others, I’ve added extra material that goes beyond the official lectures simply because I was curious.

Whether you're exploring a specific topic or just browsing, I hope these resources will help you gain a deeper understanding of the fascinating world of computing.
